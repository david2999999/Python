# A try: statement sets up a situation in which an except: statement can follow it. Each except:
# statement handles the error, which is formally named an exception that was just raised when Python
# evaluated the code within the try: statement instead of failing. To start with, use except: to handle
# one type of error â€” for instance, the KeyError that you get when trying to check the fridge.
