    # You can also use the double equals to test whether strings have the same contents, and you can even
    # restrict this test to ranges within the strings (remember from the last chapter that slices create copies of
    # the part of the strings they reference, so you â€™ re really comparing two strings that represent just the
    # range that a slice covers):

    #   Sequences can be compared in Python with the double equals as well. Python considers two
    # sequences to be equal when every element in the same position is the same in each list. Therefore, if
    # you have three items each in two sequences and they contain the same data but in a different order,
    # they are not equal:
    apples = ["Mactintosh", "Golden Delicious", "Fuji", "Mitsu"]
    apple_trees = ["Golden Delicious", "Fuji", "Mitsu", "Mactintosh"]
    print(apple_trees == apples)
    apple_trees2 = ["Mactintosh", "Golden Delicious", "Fuji", "Mitsu"];

    #     In addition, dictionaries can be compared. Like lists, every key and value (paired, together) in one
    # dictionary has to have a key and value in the other dictionary in which the key in the first is equal to
    # the key in the second, and the value in the first is equal to the value in the second:
