    # For example, you can use the letter positioning of strings to arrange them into groups in a dictionary
    # based on the first letter of the last name. You don â€™ t need to do anything complicated; you can just check
    # to see which letter the string containing the name starts with and file it under that:

    # The by_letter dictionary will, thanks to string slicing, only contain the first letter from each of the last
    # names. Therefore, by_letter is a dictionary indexed by the first letter of each last name. You could
    # also make each key in by_letter reference a list instead and use the append method of that list to create
    # a list of names beginning with that letter (if, of course, you wanted to have a dictionary that indexed a
    # larger group of names, where each one did not begin with a different letter).
