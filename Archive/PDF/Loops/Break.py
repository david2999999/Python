    # while True will always loop if left to its own devices. To solve this, you prompt the user for some info;
    # in this case, their age. So long as they enter in a number, the program will add it to their age, giving them
    # a total age and making it appear that they are getting older (unless they are savvy and enter in a negative
    # number, in which case they will get younger!). If they enter only numbers, the program will run forever.
    # However, if they ever enter in the string, No , the program will print Don â€™ t be ashamed of your age!
    # and break out of the loop.
