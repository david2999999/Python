# This is more than just useful â€” it makes sense and it saves you work. This grouping of blocks of code
# under the cover of a single name means that you can now simplify your code, which in turn enables you
# to get more done more quickly. You can type less and worry less about making a mistake as well.
# Functions are a core part of any modern programming language, and they are a key part of getting
# problems solved using Python.
