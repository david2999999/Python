# When you type a string into Python, you do so by preceding it with quotes. Whether these quotes are
# single ( ' ), double( '' ), or triple( " " " ) depends on what you are trying to accomplish. For the most part, you
# will use single quotes, because it requires less effort (you do not need to hold down the Shift key to
# create them). Note, however, that they are interchangeable with the double and even triple quotes.
