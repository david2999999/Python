Functions
    - Creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer
    - Functions allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times,
      without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code

Syntax
    def name_of_function(name):
        """
        Docstring explains function
        """
        print("Hello " + name)

    >> name_of_function("Jose")
    >> Hello Jose

    - Typically we use the return keyword to send back the result of the function,
      instead of just printing it out
    - return allows us to assign the output of the function to a new variable

Syntax
    def add_function(num1, num2):
        return num1 + num2

    >> result = add_function(1, 2)
    >> print(result)
    >> 3
