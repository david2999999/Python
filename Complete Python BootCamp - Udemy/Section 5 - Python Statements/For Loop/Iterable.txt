Iterable
    - Many objects are 'iterable' meaning we can iterate over every element in the object
        - Examples:
            - Iterate every element in a list
            - Iterate every character in a string
            - Iterate over every key in a dictionary

    - We can use 'for' loops to execute a block of code for every iteration

Syntax of a 'for' loop:
    my_iterable = [1, 2, 3]
    for item_name in my_iterable:
        print(item_name)
