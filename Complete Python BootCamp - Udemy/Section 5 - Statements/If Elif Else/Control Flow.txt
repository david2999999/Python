Control Flow
    - We often only want certain code to execute when a particular condition has been met
        - Example:
            - If my dog is hungry (condition), then I will feed the dog (some action)
    - To control the flow of logic, we use some key words
        - if, elif, else
    - Control flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation
        - This identation is what set apart python from other programming languages

Syntax of an 'if' statement
    if some_condition:
        # Execute some code

Syntax of an if/else statement
    if some_condition:
        # Execute some code
    else:
        # do something else

Syntax of checking multiple conditions
    if some_condition:
        # Execute some code
    elif some_other_condition:
        # Do something different
    else:
        # Do something else
