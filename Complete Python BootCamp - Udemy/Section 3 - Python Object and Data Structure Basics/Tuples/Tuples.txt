Tuples
    - Very similar to lists
        - But has one key difference - immutability
    - Once an element is inside a tuple, it can not be reassigned
    - Uses parenthesis: (1, 2, 3)

    - When you pass around objects in your program, you want to make sure they do not get changed
    - Data integrity
