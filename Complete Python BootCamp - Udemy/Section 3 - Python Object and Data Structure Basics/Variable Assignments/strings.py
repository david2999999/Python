# Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single quotes or double quotes
    # 'hello'
    # "Hello"
    # "Don't"
# Since strings are ordered sequences, it means we can use indexing and slice to grab sub-sections of the string
    # Indexing notation uses [] notation after the string (or variable assigned to the string)
        # Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string
            # Each character has a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab
            # There is also reverse index, where -1 is the position of the last character
    # Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters
        # The has the following syntax" [start:stop:step]
            # start is the numerical index for the slice start
            # stop is the index you will go up to (but not include)
            # step is the size of the "jump" you take
