# Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single quotes or double quotes
    # 'hello'
    # "Hello"
    # "Don't"
# Since strings are ordered sequences, it means we can use indexing and slice to grab sub-sections of the string
    # Indexing notation uses [] notation after the string (or variable assigned to the string)
    # Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string
